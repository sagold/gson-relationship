# Json Relation

A json relationship specification and implementation.


## Specification v1.0.0

> A Json Relation defines a relationship of two Json Models

**Axiom** A relationship must be resolvable through selection only

**Korollar** the related Tupel must be given by its *primary key*

**Korollar** *pivot-tables* are uni-directional


### Json Model

> A *Json Model* (relation) is an object or array containing items (*tupels*) associated with a *primary key*. Each
*tupel* consists of tupel-properties (attributes).


### Tupel

> A *tupel* is direct child object within a *Json Model*

```js
// Model
{
  "primary key": tupel
}
```


### Primary Key

> A *primary key* is given as an object-property or array-index:

```js
// Object-Model:
{
  // primary_key (entry) for following Tupel
  "entry": {
    // Attributes
    "name": "name of tupel"
  }
}
// Array-Model:
[
  // primary_key (0) for following Tupel
  {
    // Attributes
    "name": "name of tupel"
  }
]
```

### Pivot-Table

> A *pivot-table* is an object having *primary keys* as property names

```js
// Pivot for has_one relationships
{
  "pk_0": "fpk_0" // foreign primary key
}
// Pivot for has_many relationships
{
  "pk_0": ["fpk_0", "fpk_1"] // foreign primary keys
}
```

The value of a *primary key* within a *pivot-table* is refered as *foreign keyset*


### Relationship Definition

> A Relationship Object holds all neccessary information to retrieve a related object by selection

```
{
  "model": jsonModel,
  "references": relatedJsonModel,
  "type": ["1:1", "1:n"],
  "pivot": mappingObject
  "alias": pathFromTupelToRelation
}
```
